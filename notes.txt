- Main Menu - Play button, About info, Audio-off button
- Back button goes to Main Menu (with dialog making sure)

------------------

- Level complete dialog should tell you how many times you died, and your average duration-before-death/complete

- can get rid of "getting caught between 2 adjacent bodies" problem by making the entities sensors,
  with a free body surrounding them all

- run past a "post", then get to a certain point, activate something, then run back past the "post", and the map has (visibly) rotated over


During next-level-load:
com.badlogic.gdx.utils.SerializationException: Error parsing file: levels/2.tmx

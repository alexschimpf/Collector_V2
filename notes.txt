Working:
- Rethink World/Room idea
- Need to cache texture regions in AssetManager

Backlog:
- DON'T APPEND 'Entity' / 'Script' TO CLASS NAMES!!!
- Figure out what to do about friction
    - Keep everything frictionless or not?
- Make sure everything (that needs it) is disposed of
- Figure out how script system will work
    - ScriptTrigger entity?
- Allow for hierarchy in entity.json

Game ideas:
- dreamlike
- in an unknown world
- adventuring around
- understanding this new world
- lots of white, but with refreshing splashes of color
- can let my imagination roam free
- think of reality in new ways
- a playground
- things look kind of drawn, thin lines
    - slight curve to them
    - kind of like 'doodle jump'

Create a texture for each image (or more if they need animations).
Use TilesetGenerator to combine them into a tileset to use in Tiled.
Each tilemap will have an entity tileset and one or more environment tilesets.
EntityDefinition needs getTextureRegion(...).

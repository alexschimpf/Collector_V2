    - bottom of terrain is random and interesting
    - terrain is kinda hilly and random so you have to jump "perfectly"

- run past a "post", then get to a certain point, activate something, then run back past the "post", and the map has (visibly) rotated over


During next-level-load:
com.badlogic.gdx.utils.SerializationException: Error parsing file: levels/2.tmx

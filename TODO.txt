- Make entities rectangle-based to simply collision detection and movement
- DON'T APPEND 'Entity' / 'Script' TO CLASS NAMES!!!
- Figure out what to do about friction
    - Keep everything frictionless or not?
- Make sure everything (that needs it) is disposed of
- Figure out what to do about background
- Figure out how script system will work
    - ScriptTrigger entity?


- What to do about entities with no sprites?
    - Should entity be more bare?
    - Then subclass an entity with a sprite...?
    - Should they always have physics bodies?

- Entity, VisibleEntity
- Always have physics bodies
    - So they can always handle collisions the same way
        - Bodies can just be sensors, if need be
